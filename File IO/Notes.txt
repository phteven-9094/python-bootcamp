 - Reading Basic Files
    - You can read a file with the open function
        - open returns a file object to you
    - You can read a file object with the read method
 - Cursor Movement
    - Python reads a files by using a Cursor
    - This is like the cursor you see when you're typing
    - After a file is read, the cursor is at the end
    - To move the cursor, use the seek method
- Closing a Files
    - You can close a file with the close method
    - You can check if a file is clsoed with the closed attribute
    - Once closed, a file can't be read again
    - Always close files - it frees up system resources
- The With Statement
    - Preferred method of working with files
    - Automatically closes the file once ran so you don't have to manually close it
- Writing to Text Files
    - The file still needs to be opened
    - Need to specify the "w" flag as the second argument
    - Write will overwrite the orginial contents if using the "w" flag
- File Modes
    - Default is 'r' (read)
    - 'w' is for Write
    - 'a' is for appending to the end of a file if it exists
    - 'r+' Read and write to a file (writing based on cursor)
        - Will not create a file if it doesn't exist
- Truncate
    - file.truncate() resizes the file to the given number of bytes
        - If the size is not specified, the current position with be used.
