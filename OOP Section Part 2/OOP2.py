# Inheritance
    # A key feature of OOP is the ability to define a class which inherits from another class (A "base" or "parent" class)
    # In Python, inheritance works by passing the parent calss as an argument to the definition of a child class

# Properties
    #See human_class.py

# Intro to Super()
    # If you use super(), it will pull from the parent class of the current class
    
# Multiple Inheritance
    # You can pass a 2nd class when creating a new class to inherit from both of the parent classes
    # Don't have to use it; fairly rare and tends to complicate things
    
# Polymorphism
    #A key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - an object can take on many forms
    #Examples:
        # 1: The same class method works in a similar way for different classes
            # Cat.speak()
            # Dog.speak()
            # Human.speak()
        #2: The same operation works for different kinds of objects such as len()
    # 1 type The same class method works in a similar way for different classes
    # 2nd type: The same operation works for different kinds of objects such as the + sign (Adding and Concatenation)
        #Called special methods
        #See special methods file
