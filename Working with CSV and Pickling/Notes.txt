 - Reading CSV Files
    - CSV files are a common file format for tabular data
    - First row in CSV files are the headers
    - See fighters.csv for simple example
    - We can read CSV files just like other text files
    - Python has a built-in CSV module to read/write CSVs more easily
        - reader - lets you iterate over rows of the CSV as lists
        - DictReader - Lets you iterate over rows of the CSV as OrderedDicts
        - Writer - Lets you write rows of the CSV as lists
        - DictWrite - Lets you write rows of the CSV as OrderedDicts
