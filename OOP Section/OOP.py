#Defining Classes and Objects

#Classes
    #Like blueprints for objects. Classes can contain methods (functions) and attributes (Similar to keys in a dict)
#Instace
    # Objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contains their class's methods and properties
#Encapsulation
    #the grouping of public and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible
#Abstraction
    #exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods from users

#Creating Classes and Instances
    #see class_examples.py

#The __init__method
    #Anytime you make a new instance of a class, Python will automatically look for an __init__ method
    #which gets called every time you create an instance of the class (instantiate)
    #You don't need to use an __init__ method if you are creating a class with only methods
