# Rock Paper Scissors Instructions

1.  Make a rock, paper, scissors game.
2.  Start the game by asking the player:
    - "What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, or 2 for Scissors."
3.  From there, you will need to figure out:
    - How you will store the user's input
    - How you will generate a random choice for the computer
    - How you will compare the user's and computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw)
    - And how you will give feedback to the player
